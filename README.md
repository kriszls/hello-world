I'm a linguistics major an CSULB with interests in computer science and French. I'm looking to enhance my skills as a programmer and expand my background of C++, C# and Java with hopes of going into computational linguistics. I will be finishing undergrad in 2016.

My hobbies outside of academics include playing music (violin, viola, piano, guitar) and archetry.
